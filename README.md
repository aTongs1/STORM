### Download Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct checkpoints

Our base model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, which is an instruction-tuned chatbot, must be manually downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) before running the training scripts, as it won't be downloaded automatically.

### Visual Instruction Tuning

1. Prepare data

Please download the annotation of the final mixture our instruction tuning data [STORM_train_123k.jsonl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ttlyy/ORD/tree/main/ORD), and download the images from [constituting datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ttlyy/ORD).

2. Start training!

Visual instruction tuning takes around 5 hours for Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on A100 (80G), with a memory footprint of around 30GB. 

Training script with [`finetune_full_3B_ORD_Lite.sh`](https://github.com/aTongs1/STORM/blob/main/scripts/finetune_full_3B_ORD_Lite.sh).

If you are do not have enough GPU memory:

- Use LoRA: [`finetune_lora_3B_ORD_Lite.sh`](https://github.com/aTongs1/STORM/blob/main/scripts/finetune_lora_3B_ORD_Lite.sh). 

If you are interested in finetuning Qwen model on our MAX-dataset, please use the training script [`finetune_full_3B_ORD_MAX.sh`](https://github.com/aTongs1/STORM/blob/main/scripts/finetune_full_3B_ORD_MAX.sh).
